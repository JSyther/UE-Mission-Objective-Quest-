/**
 * FMissionObjective:
 * Represents an individual objective within a mission, encapsulating
 * descriptive details, progress tracking (e.g., counts for collection or kill goals),
 * and completion status. Designed to be flexible enough to support
 * a variety of mission tasks, it includes reset functionality to allow
 * easy mission retries or state resets.
 * 
 * FMissionData:
 * Encapsulates all relevant data for a mission, including unique identification,
 * descriptive metadata (title, narrative), current mission state (NotStarted, InProgress, Completed, Failed),
 * and a collection of related mission objectives.
 * 
 * It further maintains reward information such as experience points and currency,
 * which are granted upon successful completion of the mission.
 * 
 * The structure supports key utility methods to reset the mission state and objectives,
 * as well as to assess whether all objectives have been completed, enabling
 * straightforward integration with mission management systems.
 * 
 * This modular and extensible design facilitates maintainability and scalability,
 * allowing for easy addition of new mission parameters, objectives, or reward types.
 * It separates mission data representation from mission logic, promoting clean
 * architecture principles and easing integration with Unreal Engineâ€™s serialization
 * and Blueprint systems.
 * 
 * Intended for use in diverse mission-based gameplay systems, this design
 * can accommodate simple linear quests as well as more complex, branching mission structures.
